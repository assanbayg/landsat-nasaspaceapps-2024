# TRITON - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024

## About

Our challenge was **Imagine our Connected Earth** where we had to demonstrate how changes in one system can alter another system. NextJS app is stored in the `frontend` folder. I used Three.js and Google Maps API to showcase our Earth. In the `notebooks` folder our data scientist (Kenessary) predicts the wildfires using the Random Forest Classifier model.
